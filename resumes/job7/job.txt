SentiLink
Senior Data Scientist - Full Stack

About us:
SentiLink provides innovative identity and risk solutions, empowering institutions and individuals to transact confidently with one another.

By building the future of identity verification in the United States and reinventing the currently clunky, ineffective, and expensive process, we believe strongly that the future will be 10x better.

We’ve had tremendous traction and are growing extremely quickly. Already our real-time APIs have helped verify hundreds of millions of identities, beginning with financial services. In 2021, we raised a $70M Series B round, led by Craft Ventures to rapidly scale our best in class products. We’ve earned coverage and awards from TechCrunch, CNBC, Bloomberg, Forbes, Business Insider, PYMNTS, American Banker, LendIt, and have been named to the Forbes Fintech 50 list consecutively since 2023. Last but not least, we’ve even been a part of history - we were the first company to go live with the eCBSV and testified before the United States House of Representatives.

Role:
As a Senior Data Scientist at SentiLink, you will build our core products: models that identify fraudsters and also advance our growing suite of products in financial risk. As an experienced researcher you will be relied upon to be technically capable and the definitive owner of your respective domain. You will often work on projects with high visibility and impact that require deep domain understanding, critical thinking and strong technical abilities. You will work with teams across the company to research new types of fraud, develop new products, and provide analysis to drive sales and marketing. This is a full-stack data science role, involving model development, analysis, and writing production code. You should be interested in having end-to-end ownership and a fast-moving environment where deep domain understanding drives development and unusual insights drive our competitive advantage rather than optimization of new machine learning methodologies.
