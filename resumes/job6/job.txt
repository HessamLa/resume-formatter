The Skills and Qualities You’ll Bring Include:
* Proven experience building and deploying AI systems in production using Python and modern ML frameworks.
* Hands-on expertise with:
   * scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow – for model development.
   * AWS Bedrock, Sagemaker, HuggingFace, or similar cloud AI stacks.
   * CrewAI or other orchestration frameworks for agentic AI systems.
   * Pandas, NumPy, Airflow, or Databricks for data engineering and workflow automation.
* Strong understanding of model lifecycle management, including monitoring, retraining, and versioning.
* Ability to balance trade-offs between model performance, latency, and interpretability.
* Familiarity with cybersecurity, or experience in other high-signal domains such as finance, healthcare, or marketplaces, is a strong plus.

You as a Person:
* Thrive in a dynamic, iterative environment where experimentation drives progress.
* Balance autonomy with accountability, delivering high-impact results while collaborating openly.
* Have a strong sense of ownership and focus on delivering AI capabilities that add measurable business value.
