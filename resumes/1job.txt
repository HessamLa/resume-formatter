About NODA
NODA is a veteran-owned, venture-backed technology company that is transforming how unmanned systems collaborate in complex, mission-critical environments. We are developing next-generation solutions that enable the autonomous orchestration of heterogeneous unmanned systems across air, sea, land, and space with vital applications in the defense, intelligence, and commercial sectors.

Our AI/ML Engineers are at the cutting edge of autonomous intelligence, designing and implementing AI agents that seamlessly bridge mission intent with real-world execution through advanced reasoning frameworks and multi-domain orchestration capabilities.

Joining NODA means working on meaningful technology that pushes the boundaries of autonomy alongside a team that thrives on innovation, rapid iteration, and collaboration.

The Role
We are seeking an AI/ML Engineer to design and implement intelligent agents that drive adaptive mission planning and orchestration across multi-domain unmanned systems. This role focuses on LLM orchestration frameworks, agent reasoning systems, and the deployment of AI models to edge computing environments on autonomous vehicles.

You will build systems that translate high-level mission intent into actionable autonomous behaviors, dynamically adapt plans as environments change, and provide explainable reasoning to human operators. Your work will integrate directly with our ROS autonomy stack while ensuring reliable AI performance on resource-constrained edge hardware.

Key Responsibilities
Design and implement LLM orchestration frameworks for mission planning and task decomposition across heterogeneous vehicle fleets

Develop agent reasoning systems that bridge high-level mission objectives with executable autonomy commands

Optimize largeand quantize language models and agent frameworks for deployment on edge computing hardware (Jetson, companion computers)

Manage the full lifecycle of AI agents including model versioning, prompt engineering, tool integration, and memory management

Implement human-in-the-loop workflows that provide transparent, explainable AI reasoning to operators

Integrate AI reasoning outputs with autonomy middleware (e.g., ROS 2) to enable seamless mission execution across heterogeneous

Build evaluation, monitoring, and logging systems to track agent performance, reliability, and cost in operational environments

Develop safe deployment and rollback practices for AI agents in mission-critical scenarios

Collaborate with autonomy engineers to ensure AI-generated plans are executable and safe across multi-domain platforms

Validate agent behaviors through simulation-in-loop testing before field deployment

Design AI systems that maintain effectiveness in denied, degraded, and contested communication environments

Required Qualifications
3+ years of experience in production AI/ML applications with emphasis on LLM deployment and orchestration

Proficiency in Python and modern AI/ML frameworks (PyTorch, Transformers, LangChain, or equivalent orchestration tools)

Experience with model optimization, quantization, and deployment to edge computing environments

Understanding of distributed systems and real-time AI inference requirements

Familiarity with MLOps practices, including model versioning, monitoring, and lifecycle management

Knowledge of prompt engineering, agent framework design, and multi-step reasoning systems

Experience with constraint solving, planning algorithms, or symbolic reasoning approaches

U.S. Citizenship with the ability to obtain a security clearance

Preferred Qualifications
Experience with multi-agent coordination frameworks and distributed AI reasoning systems

Background in robotics or autonomous systems integration (ROS2ROS 2, navigation stacks, sensor fusion)

Familiarity with reinforcement learning for planning and decision-making applications. Understanding; understanding of secure coding practices and adversarial robustness in AI-driven systems.

Experience deploying AI models to embedded hardware (Jetson, Raspberry Pi, or similar edge devices)

Exposure to simulation-in-loop and hardware-in-loop testing environments

Knowledge of autonomous vehicle domains (UAVs, USVs, UUVs) and associated protocols

Background in structured data preparation and feature engineering for AI ingestion

Contributions to open-source AI or robotics projects

Experience contributing to mission assurance and safety cases, including field-readiness reviews
