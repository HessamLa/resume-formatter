## Research Experience

### Graph Embedding and Graph ML
**Purdue University** | _PhD Thesis_

Researched graph embedding methods. Invented a graph embedding methodology using force-directed approach and provided a mathematical proof-of-convergence using Brouwer's fixed point theorem. Optimized complexity of the method from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n). This method can be employed in supervised or unsupervised learning schemes. Made extensive use of PyTorch framework, CUDA library, GPU unit and memory optimization methods. Implemented parallelized algorithms for multi-GPU execution using SLURM. Improved graph task metrics (link prediction, node classification, etc.) by over 6% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Developed a library to optimize the memory utilization by searching for an optimum batch count during run time. Used "wrapper" design pattern to implement a Python decorator for the batch-count optimizer during run-time. Implemented an experiment tracking system using MLFlow.

**Technical Environment:** Deployed models on multi-GPU clusters using SLURM for resource management

**Applied Methods:** Force-Directed approach | PyTorch | CUDA | Memory optimization | Multi-GPU scaling | SLURM job orchestration | Experiment tracking

### Large-Scale Knowledge Graph Processing
**Eli Lilly and Company** | _Internship Project_

Researched optimized methods for extracting subgraphs from large-scale knowledge graph and visualizing it. The objective was to provide a KG tool with search and visual exploration features, helping the user better explore the KG. The users of this tool were scientists and domain experts from various departments (chemistry/pharma, finance, marketing, etc.). In addition, for enhancing user experience, a smooth transition between various levels of visualization granularities was implemented.

**Applied Methods:** Force-Directed | ForceAtlas | Community detection | Clustering | GraphViz

### DDoS Attack Detection and Mitigation in SDN
**Purdue University** | _Research Project_

Researched DDoS attacks and development of methods for their detection and mitigation. In this research, the network traffic flows were collected in set intervals. Then they were compiled into time series data for processing using entropy analysis and neural network models for classification and prediction. Proposed the idea of partitioning incoming traffic based on various parameters. Then, each partition was effectively a separate time series data.

**Applied Methods:** Entropy analysis | Group testing | RNN and CRNN

### Quantum Computer Scheduler
**Amirkabir University (QDA group)** | _Master's Thesis_

Designed and implemented a method and algorithm for scheduling ion-trap quantum computers with the goal of reducing execution latency of quantum program. Reduced the scheduling latency by 50% average compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

**Applied Methods:** OOP in C++ | Lee's maze routing
