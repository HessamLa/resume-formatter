        Researched and developed graph embedding methods using force-directed approach with mathematical proof-of-convergence using Brouwer's fixed point theorem. Optimized algorithm complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n). Method applicable in both supervised and unsupervised learning schemes. Utilized PyTorch framework, CUDA library, and GPU memory optimization techniques. Implemented parallelized algorithms for multi-GPU execution using SLURM. Achieved over 6% improvement in graph task metrics (link prediction, node classification) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Developed library to optimize memory utilization by searching for optimum batch count during runtime. Implemented Python decorator for batch-count optimization using wrapper design pattern.
